# import array
# arr = array.array('i',[1,2,3,4])
# print(arr)

# arr = array.array('q',[2323,4545,465656,3546466])
# print(arr)

# band B are for byte type.
# h and H are for short type
# i and I are for int type
# l and L are for Long type
# f and d are for decimal type values.
# Capital Characters are if you want to use unsigned integer type.

# import array as arr
# hello = arr.array('i',[1,2,4,5])
# print(hello)

# from array import *
# hello = array('i',[12,34,545,6767])
# print(hello)

# Always prefer the third method of creating arrays since it is most widely used and easy to remember.
