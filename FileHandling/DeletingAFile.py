os is a very important python module which consists of lot of important functions like deleting a file or a folder.
This module is not always present like the print function and to use the functions present in it we need to
import it.
'''
import os
# os.remove("C:/Users/ranu hp/Desktop/tagger.txt")
# os.rmdir("C:/Users/ranu hp/Downloads/Kaise HoAapLog")

#  Moving towards the end of the topic I would like to discuss the usage of FileHandling.
#  Lets discuss a scenario:
#  We made a program requiring a lot of data. One possibility is to provide data manually that is the user input
#  But this becomes a very rigourous approach when it comes to billions of data.
#  So effective approach is to store data in a file and provide that file as the input.
#  This will reduce human effort since computer will automatically read the file and extract data from it.
