# marks = 57
# if(marks>75):
#     print("You passed with distinction")
# elif(marks>60 and marks<75):
#     print("You passed with flying colours")
# elif(marks>40 and marks<60):
#     print("You hardly passed")
# else:
#     print("You failed")

# This is a very special statement that is elif statement which restricts the running code to it.
# What does it mean??
# Basically if the condition present in elif is found true then it stops further checking the remaining statements.
