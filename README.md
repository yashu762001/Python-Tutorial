# Python-Tutorial
This consists of complete python from scratch. There is a commented code for all the topics in python starting from basic syntax to arithmetic operators, using numpy package, file handling, exception handling etc. I have also provided code for some common questions on for loop and while loop.
It is a properly commented code so that you can also understand the theory of the topic along with the code.
