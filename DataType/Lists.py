# Here we are able to do this since the lists are not immutable but the strings are. So for Strings we used
# a method named replace,but here we can directly do.
# Since strings are immutable so once created can't be changed, only the location can start pointing to some other
# string and that string is there somewhere in the memory.

# fruits.reverse()
# print(fruits)

# fruits.sort()
# print(fruits)

# fruits.append("apple")
# print(fruits)
# print(fruits.count("apple"))

# list = ['apple',23,'bucket']
# list.sort()
# print(list)

# Obvious Point yet need to be mentioned: We can't sort a list consisting both numbers and
# strings.

# fruits.extend(vegetables)
# print(fruits)

#  We have extend method in python which performs the work similar to the addAll method in JAVA.
